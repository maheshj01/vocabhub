# flutter_template

A Flutter Template to clone and start working directly on your application.

This is created with an intention to save your time doing repetative work with your new project like creating folder structure, adding files to gitignore, adding localization networking capabilities.

Feel free to fork this repo and modify this template as you like. If this template helps you save even 15 mins on your new project the goal is reached.

## Things to do post fork
 
 1. Change the AppTitle
    
    **Android** 

    a) navigate to file ```android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml``` 
    
    b) local for lable named ```android:label```    
    
    **IOS** 
 
    a) navigate to file ```ios/Runner/Info.plist``` 
    
    b) look for
      ```
        <key>CFBundleName</key>
        <string>App Name</string>
      ```
    
    Still stuck [look here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49353199/how-can-i-change-the-app-display-name-build-with-flutter)

 2. Change the package name, The default package name is (```com.example.flutter_create```)
    Use search and replace feature of your IDE to get this done.

 3. If your app does not need localization delete ```lib/locales``` directory and also delete the corresponding packages
  from pubspec.yaml
   -  flutter_localizations:
   -  flutter_cupertino_localizations
 
 4. Look for ```lib/models/user_model.dart``` an example for generating json serializable is given there
 
  ```
  flutter pub run build_runner build
 
  flutter pub run build_runner watch // watches the file changes
  ```

  _for more look at the example file at `lib/models/user_model.dart`_
